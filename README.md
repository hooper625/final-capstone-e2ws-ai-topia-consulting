### What Each Folder Is For

| Folder | What Goes Here | Who Uses It |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| `data/raw/` | Original CSV files and images downloaded from the shared Google Drive link. Do not modify these files. | Everyone |
| `data/processed/` | Cleaned, transformed, feature-engineered versions of the raw data. This is what your models actually train on. | Data Engineering Lead |
| `models/model1_*/` through `model5_*/` | Each model gets its own folder. `train.py` trains the model, `predict.py` loads and runs it, `saved_model/` stores the trained weights. | Each model's lead owner |
| `notebooks/` | Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation. Notebooks are for exploration only — final code goes in `.py` files. | Everyone |
| `pipelines/data_pipeline.py` | Shared functions that all models use — data loading, cleaning, feature engineering, train/test splitting. Write it once, import everywhere. | Data Engineering Lead |
| `webapp/` | Your deployed Streamlit web app that integrates all 5 models. Run with `streamlit run webapp/app.py`. Deploy to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) for free. | Everyone (shared responsibility) |
| `test_data/` | **Do not touch.** The instructor will place test data here during evaluation. Your `predict.py` scripts read from this folder. | Instructor only |
| `output_templates/` | Example CSVs showing the **exact** output format each model must produce. Open these and match them precisely. | Reference — do not modify |

## Critical Rules

### 1. Output Format is Non-Negotiable

Each model's `predict.py` must output a CSV that **exactly matches** the template in `output_templates/`. Same column names. Same data types. Same order. No exceptions.

Your evaluation script will fail if your output doesn't match. This is intentional — in the real world, your client's systems expect data in a specific format.

### Output Format Reference

Each model has a different output CSV format. Use this table as a quick reference — your `predict.py` must produce columns that **exactly match** these.

| Model | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 | Column 4 | Column 5 |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Model 1** (Traditional ML) | `id` | `prediction` | `probability` | `confidence` | — |
| **Model 2** (Deep Learning) | `id` | `prediction` | `probability` | `confidence` | — |
| **Model 3** (CNN) | `image_id` | `predicted_class` | `confidence` | — | — |
| **Model 4** (NLP) | `id` | `predicted_class` | `confidence` | — | — |
| **Model 5** (Innovation) | `id` | `prediction` | `confidence` | `metric_name` | `metric_value` |

**Key differences to watch for:**
- **Model 3 uses `image_id`**, not `id` — because predictions correspond to image files (e.g., `img_0001.png`), not numeric record IDs.
- **Models 3 and 4 use `predicted_class`**, not `prediction` — because they output categorical class labels rather than binary/numeric predictions.
- **Model 5 includes extra columns** (`metric_name`, `metric_value`) for your custom evaluation metric.
- **Models 1 and 2 include `probability`** (the raw model output probability) in addition to `confidence`.

**Note:** The example values in the templates are illustrative. Use your scenario's actual class labels (e.g., severity 1-4 for smart city, 0/1 for healthcare binary predictions, actual category names for NLP).

Always check `output_templates/` for the authoritative format. If your output doesn't match, you will lose 5 points per model.

### 2. No Notebooks as Final Deliverables

Notebooks are for exploration. Your final model code must be in `.py` files inside the `models/` directory. Models submitted only as notebooks will receive a **-5 point deduction**.

### 3. Models Must Be Saved and Loadable

Your `predict.py` scripts must:
- Load a pre-trained model from `saved_model/`
- Accept test data as input
- Output predictions to `test_data/modelN_results.csv`

Do NOT retrain during prediction. If your model requires retraining to make predictions, it's not production-ready.

### 4. File Naming Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for all file and folder names
- Model artifacts: `model_name.joblib`, `model_name.h5`, `model_name.keras`
- No spaces in file names. Ever.
- No duplicate versions (`model_v2_final_FINAL.py` — don't do this)

### 5. Data Stays Out of Git

Large data files and model weights should NOT be committed to git. Use `.gitignore`. Your `data/raw/` folder should contain only a README explaining where to get the data.

---

## How Your Models Will Be Evaluated

1. I will place test data in your `test_data/` folder
2. I will run `python bulk_test.py --all`
3. The script calls each model's `predict.py` with the test data
4. Your predictions are compared against ground truth I hold back
5. Metrics are calculated automatically
6. **If your script crashes, that model scores 0**

### What "Runs" Means

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt    # Must work without errors
python bulk_test.py --all          # Must produce test_data/model{1-5}_results.csv
```

No manual steps. No "you need to run this notebook first." No "change this path." It either runs or it doesn't.

## Getting Started

1. **Read your scenario spec** — understand the business problem and datasets
2. **Read `preprocessing_hints.py` carefully** — this file is in your scenario folder (healthcare/ or smart_city/), not in this repo. It contains critical data preparation steps including target variable creation, category mapping, and class imbalance warnings. Skipping this will cost you significant points.
3. **Explore the data** — use `notebooks/eda.ipynb` to understand what you're working with
4. **Build your data pipeline** — `pipelines/data_pipeline.py` for shared preprocessing
5. **Develop models** — one team member leads each, everyone contributes
6. **Test your outputs** — make sure they match the templates BEFORE submission
7. **Build the web app** — integrate all models into a single interface
8. **Deploy** — deploy to [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) (free). Push your repo to GitHub, connect it to Streamlit Cloud, and your app gets a public URL

## Team Roles

| Role | Primary Responsibility | Models |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| **Data Engineering Lead** | Data cleaning, feature engineering, pipelines | Supports all |
| **ML / DNN Lead** | Traditional ML + Deep Learning models | Model 1 & 2 |
| **CNN Lead** | Image classification, computer vision | Model 3 |
| **NLP Lead** | Text classification | Model 4 |

**Model 5 (Innovation)** is a shared team responsibility. **Everyone** contributes to the web app and presentation.

## Weekly Sprint Check-Ins

Every week, your team must submit a **sprint check-in** via Slack before your weekly meeting with the instructor. Use the `weekly-sprint-template.md` included in this repo.

This includes:
- What you accomplished that week
- What you're working on next
- Any blockers or challenges
- Updated model status tracker

These check-ins are part of your **Collaboration & Process** grade. Consistent, honest updates show professionalism. Silence until demo day does not.
